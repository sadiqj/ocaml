(* Detection of recursive handlers that are not guaranteed to poll
   at every loop iteration. *)

(* The result of the analysis is a mapping from handlers H
   (= loop heads) to Booleans b and polling decisions.

   b is true if every path starting from H goes through an Ialloc,
   Ipoll, Ireturn, Itailcall_ind or Itailcall_imm instruction.
   In this case, we say that H is "safe".
   b is also true if we decide to insert a poll at the head of H.

   (Iraise is treated like Ireturn if not handled locally, or like
    a branch to the nearest enclosing exception handler.)

   b is false, therefore, if starting from H we can loop infinitely
   without crossing an Ialloc or Ipoll instruction.
   In this case, we say that H is "unsafe".
*)

(* The analysis is a backward dataflow analysis starting from false,
   using && (Boolean "and") as the join operator,
   and with the following transfer function:

   TRANSF(Ialloc | Ipoll | Itailcall_ind | Itailcall_imm _ | Ireturn) = true
   TRANSF(all other operations, x) = x
*)

(* We modify the code during the analysis in the following way:
   As soon as we find a recursive catch with some unsafe handlers
   we mark one of them for poll insertion, then we resume the analysis
   to determine whether there are still some unsafe handlers.

   Note that this means the analysis must return true in the end because
   it will have inserted polls in all unsafe loops.

(* Detection of functions that can loop via a tail-call without going
   through a poll point. *)

(* The result of the analysis is a single Boolean b.

   b is true if there exists a path from the function entry to a
   Potentially Recursive Tail Call (an Itailcall_ind or
   Itailcall_imm to a forward function)
   that does not go through an Ialloc or Ipoll instruction.

   b is false, therefore, if the function always polls (via Ialloc or Ipoll)
   before doing a PRTC.

   To compute b, we do a backward dataflow analysis starting from
   false, using || (Boolean "or") as the join operator, and with the
   following transfer function:

   TRANSF(Ialloc | Ipoll, x) = false
   TRANSF(Itailcall_ind, x) = true
   TRANSF(Itailcall_imm f, x) = f is a forward function
   TRANSF(all other operations, x) = x
